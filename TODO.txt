design:
- not a great experience to have to click the microphone icon twice: recording should start as soon as /new loads
- pressing Enter in NameModal should trigger the Save action
- duration on new transcript is .000 instead of .0
bugs:
- error banner in mobile mode: (x) is on top of error message instead of floating left
- error thrown when speechRecognition isn't available (Firefox) isn't rendered in +error.svelte but in console instead as: Uncaught (in promise) 
Object { status: 503, body: {â€¦} }
- on Safari, no result is final unless recognition is stopped :facepalm: it seems interim results always have a confidence of 1 whereas the last result after speech ends has a confidence between ]0, 1[ (excluded)
  but adding if (resultFinal || (!result.isFinal && result[0].confidence !== 1)) { reco.stop()
  is not good enough. Fixes Safari but causes recognition to be stopped more often than necessary on Chrome which lead to loss of words in the transcript.
- page content slides up the navbar on all 3 pages
- on new transcript page, live transcript doesn't scroll up and disappear under bottom action bar
